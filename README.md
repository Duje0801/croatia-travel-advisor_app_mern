I have developed a project inspired by TripAdvisor, utilizing JavaScript (React and Typescript) and CSS (SCSS), Node.js (Express, MongoDB, Mongoose and Typescript).

Server is on render.com. Occasionally, server performance may be slower, requiring some patience for proper functionality.

Unregistered users can search for destinations or browse reviews for a specific destination. Only the admin can manage destinations, all users and all reviews. A user can only manage their own reviews. A user can change their email and password and can restart the password if forgotten (receives a token for password reset via email).
